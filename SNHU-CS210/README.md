# CS210 Banking Project

A program created to allow a user to calculate total accrual of interest to a bank account over a time (input by user).

## Description

The program takes an initial investment amount, a monthly deposit (if used), an annual interest percentage and a number of years and then creates two tables to display total account buildup over that set years. The first table on screen shows the balance and interest without monthly deposits and the second table shows the same information with the added monthly deposits. Both screens allow the user to view the information before moving on by pausing on what is being shown.

## Questions about the project 
#### What did you do particiularly well?

In this project, there were several things I had wanted to do that I had not had full understanding of yet. I spent much of the time at the beginning of the project researching tools like the format tools and system tools for windows in order to pause the screen. I feel that the interactivity is done well, in which information is displayed efficiently and in a visually appealing way.

#### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

Looking over my code, I know theres spots where my code can be cumbersome. With more practice on low-level concepts, I feel I could write more efficient code, but this ended up being a good baseline for me. As far as efficiency, I know my code can run well on windows machines, but it is not portable. I used many tools and tricks for windows machines to allow the program to pause and clear the screen. 

#### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging parts of this code came down to running the equations to get the amounts and to display than in a loop. Although I could get the amount for any given year, I could not properly run that into a loop while displaying it to screen until I took a moment away from the computer. I read through a few modules on ZyBooks and re-approached the problem, this time being able to complete it.

#### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Many of the concepts used in this course have provided a baseline for C++, and I'm excited to utilize those concepts in future projects. In this project, I was able to combine many different concepts and perform formatting to make it presentable to a user. This will come in handy as I make more presentable projects in future high-level courses.

#### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The primary way this program was made more efficient was from seperating parts of the code into functions and using a header file. Any edits in the future will be easier to maintain as editing a function once will make the difference across the program.
