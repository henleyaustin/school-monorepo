-   Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The foundation of the project was laid out with pre-written code that included the maze's environment, a learning mechanism through experience replay, and a neural network model structure. My contribution was crafting the Q-Training Algorithm, where I programmed the agent to learn the most efficient routes to the treasure, focusing on adaptive learning and decision-making.

-   What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Computer scientists solve complex issues by developing algorithms and using computational tools. My work on the Pirate Intelligent Agent project involved crafting an algorithm that guides a virtual pirate through a maze to find treasure. This project demonstrates how computer scientists approach problems: breaking them down into smaller pieces, thinking creatively to find solutions, and then refining these solutions through testing and iteration. It's a blend of analytical thinking and innovation, showing the importance of computer science in creating solutions that are both effective and efficient. This approach not only solved the maze challenge but also showcased the practical application of computer science principles in solving real-world problems.

-   What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Jumping into this project also highlighted the ethical problems shown in creating intelligent systems. It underscored the need for transparency, fairness, and predictability in the systems we develop. Although the project's scope was smaller, it still showed the larger responsibility of ensuring our technological advancements serve the public good without unintended negative consequences.
