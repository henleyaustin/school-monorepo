# SNHU-CS305

## Description

The course focused on analyzing code to ensure secure coding practices and compliance with security testing protocols. Encryption technologies and techniques were also implemented within the code to help learn the best practices in regards to secure applications.

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that is wanting to secure their already existing software. They have a file upload feature within your web application that needed to be refined to be secure with the most recent security precautions.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

In my code I was able to implement a hashing algorithm and deploy a cipher. The code had the most recent and actively used cipher to ensure all data transmissions were secure. Overall, software security ensures that code is protexted against attackers, but aso ensures that their is trust with the users. Its important that all user information is protected to the best of the designers ability.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was manually reviewing the code. It can be easy to miss small problems within the code, especially after writing it yourself. The most helpful was the dependency check, since it was able to check against already known vulnerabilities with the resources being used.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased the security in the application by implementing hashing and a cipher into the application. An important tool to use is the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram. By viewing different categories of security issues, the application could be approached from a top-down view of what it is being used for and security mitigation techniques could be chosen for the specific applications.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I checked the code using two methods. First, I output the final cipher and hashing values to the screen to ensure those functions worked correctly. Secondly, I reran the dependency check tool to ensure no new dependency issues were introduced into the code.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The dependency check tool will be especially helpful in future projects, to ensure there are no major issues within the packages I am using. Other than that, the secure practices learned in this course will benefit me in all future projects, simply through ensuring I'm using the best practices.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show my implementations within the final project. The use of a cipher and hashing algorithm shows that they can be implemented in legitimate projects as well.
