# SNHU-CS330

## Description

This course focused on creating interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of API libraries and modern OpenGL. 

## Essential Questions

#### How did you approach designing the software?

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The software design in this course relied on an abundance of boilerplate code for OpenGL, but creating the meshes for different objects allowed me to think about how to efficiently organize the code. I chose to utilize methods that managed the sizes and detail of the meshes, therefore making each object's code more compact and departmentalized. I also go the chance to seperate that information into a header to seperate from the main code. I plan on following similar structures in future code. 

#### How do you approach developing programs?

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Fortunately, the class was structured in a way that I was able to chip away at the final project through the eight weeks of the class. My scene had four objects, so I could work on each object seperately and build them week by week. The development process for the main code was an iterative process, where I added and fixed errors in iterations. Overall, the iterative approach helped write the code, but also helped understand what I was learning more efficiently.

#### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

More than anything, computational graphics helps to build a "builders" mindset. The methods and syntax for OpenGL is strict and requires well-written code to be able to correctly represent items on screen. For future courses, having developed within OpenGL will help me write better code for other projects. Professionally, if I ever explore a role within computer graphics, I will have a better understanding of what it takes to visualize items on screen. I can utilize a similar approach in professional projects with having seperate methods for different objects on screen.
