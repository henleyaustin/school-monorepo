## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Making sure that code is completely functional and secure involves delicate planning, writing and testing. By breaking down the code into small manageable pieces, I an focus on efficiency and modularity, making it easier to refactor in the future. By implementing unit tests for each method, I am also able to ensure the functionality against each of  the requirements. Also, following the best practices for security, such as input validation and efficient data handling, ensures secure software.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting and incorporating user needs requires you to have a clear understanding. By converting user needs into defined, specific requirements and commenting them into the code, I am able to create a layout and structure to follow as I write the code. By following this method, I am able to stay focused on  the users needs by creating the software.

## How do I approach designing software?

When I start designing software, I find its best to create the structure before I ever begin actually writing the code. I will plan out what classes will exist and what functionality they will need. This allows me to be more efficient by writing code in smaller modules, but also to stay on track for an end goal.
