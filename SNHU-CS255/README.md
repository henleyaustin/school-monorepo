# CS255 -  System Analysis and Design 

## Description

Exploration into the principles, methods and techniques used in systems development. Practice creating system models using appropriate industry tools and then effectively communicating the technical concepts to verious audiences in a professional manner.

## Essential Questions

#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The main project of the course was to build a system design for the client DriverPass. DriverPass is a company with a goal of creating a solution for the increasing fail rate of students taking their driving exams. They wanted to provide users with an efficient online environment that allowed users to schedule driving tests with DriverPass instructors and take online education. The application allowed users to log in to their account to purchase and access their courses, while tracking their progress and staying updated with current DMV policies and procedures.

#### What did you do particularly well? What would you revise and how would you improve it?

I think my diagrams were well thought out and planned. I approached them by first drawing a physical rough draft on paper, then using that rough draft as my reference when creating it on lucid chart. It allowed me to ensure everything I wanted to show in the diagram would be there.

Although most of the diagrams felt well prepared, I think the sequence diagram was the hardest to wrap my head around. I had trouble explaining each part of the process, and I feel some important actions were left out. I would revise it to show more of the *handshakes* between the DriverPass back-end and the databases, as I believe there should be more communication shown between those two actors.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took careful notes based off the interview transcript with the client. After learning more about functional and non-functional requirements, I was able to structure my notes based of where they would be implemented and how they would be interpreted into the system. THe user needs are a vital part of system design. You could build a whole system, but if they do not meet the requirements of what the customer needs, then it will not be utilized. It's important to build a system from the ground up based off of the users requirements.

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think an important part of software design is breaking it down into steps. Many steps of the system design process require information from previous steps, so it's important that the first few steps in collecting and analyzing requirements be thorough and not underestimated. Communication and collaboration are also equally important. Ensuring that the teams working on the software communicate effectively, but also that stakeholders are involved in the process through reviews and presentations.
