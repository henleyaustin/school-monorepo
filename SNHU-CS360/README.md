<h2 align="center"> Inventory App - Streamline Inventory </h2>  

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was designed to address the need for efficient and simple inventory management. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly tool for small businesses, individuals, or anyone seeking a streamlined method to track and manage inventory items.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To meet user needs, the app included a few essential screens and features like:
-  A login and registration screen for secure access
-  An inventory _dashboard_ displaying all items with options to add, edit, delete, or sort them.
-  Settings screen for user preferences like SMS alerts or two-factor authentication
When approaching the UI, I focused on clarity and ease of use. Readable text, easy navigation and familiar icons were a big part of designing the app. The success of the designs is due to the approachable nature of the app.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My coding process was methodical and structured. I utilized the best practices like the MVC architecture to separate functionalities of the app, making the code more manageable and scalable. I also continued to revisit portions of the code to refactor for optimization and readability. I plan to continue using this approach in future projects to make sure they can continue to grow.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Functional testing was a large part of my development process. I tested each function as I went through the android emulator. I attempted edge cases to ensure bugs were hard to come across. 
This thorough testing was crucial and revealed bugs early, to make sure it is a smooth user experience. It also reinforced the reliability of the app, which is crucial for inventory management software.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A big challenge was implementing the SMS notification feature and preferences. I tried utilizing it for 2FA as well but kept hitting a wall. In the end, I walked through documentation and integrated the languageâ€™s ability to send SMS's from the phone itself and made a system that works well.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel that the main inventory screen was a testament to what I had learned in this course. I spent a lot of time on the Java class itself making sure it was well documented and efficiently organized. There were also many checks in place to ensure the app had minimal bugs and ran smoothly.
