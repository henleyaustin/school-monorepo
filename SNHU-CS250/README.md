# CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle

## Description

Exploration of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through the lens of the roles associated with an Agile developmental process. The best practices are utilized to develop high-quality software, while also stressing the importance of communication, documentation, and ethics within the SDLC.

## Essential Questions
#### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The baseline requirements of a project are converted into user stories. Foundational parts of the project are easier to plan as there isn't as much "guessing work" involved. User stories do multiple things for a development team. They help to disassemble the project into manageable bites. Especially at the developer level, when a user story is smaller, it allows the team to be more focused and work with fewer details. Also, user stories help keep a focus on the customer experience. Each user story should add value to the product in some way. 

In an Agile/Scrum-based SDLC, the role focused on creating a backlog of user stories is the product owner. They communicate heavily with the customer but also can utilize focus groups. These focus groups consist of potential users and they are asked about what they would like to see in a finished product. From this, requirements are built around what a user would want. 

#### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I approach development, I tend to quickly plan out based on what information I have. I create a quick rough draft of known requirements and then jump into creating the code. For future work, I plan to approach projects in functional pieces. When tearing down the project into smaller pieces of usable code, It's easier to test and constantly focus on creating high-quality working software.

#### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is an active one. Especially within an Agile/Scrum team, good teams have come from transparency and active communication. Both raising a hand but also offering a hand goes a long way toward building a strong team. Contribution to all processes can help stay versatile as well.
