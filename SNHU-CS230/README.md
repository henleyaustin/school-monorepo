Exploration of the operating platforms and architectures through analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. 

## Essential Questions
#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that currently had a mobile game on the market called "Draw It or Lose It". They wanted to translate their game into a web-based game with multiple users. Their big focus was on compatibility and user access so that they could expand their audience.

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel I was able to explore several viable options and describe them well. When writing the evaluation, I feel I was able to explain the different needs and options of the different operating systems well. I spoke about the several considerations to make when looking at each OS. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Planning can play a big part in writing efficient code. The design document allowed me to think through the project and view the bigger picture. It also shifted my focus more toward compatibility and how to ensure that the code will be functional for all users.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the recommendations portion of the document. I feel like having a real-life example of this document could help me understand the collaboration between the development team and the customer. I would improve upon it by making in-depth recommendations that can be used by the customer.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Using the design document, I was able to split up the functionality of the project into several parts. The important needs of the client have to be considered. I had to ask the question - Overall, what are they looking for? I feel reliability and functionality are a must since it's important to grow its audience of users.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would utilize documentation more heavily going forward. I feel being able to design the product helps plan out expectations. Also, starting with baseline requirements and building upon that with iterative developments is a good approach to a good end product.
