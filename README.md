# School Work Mono Repo

This repository contains all my school projects, assignments, and code samples, previously separated into individual private repos. By consolidating them here, I’ve made it easier to manage and keep everything in one place.

## Structure

Each folder in this mono repo represents a different course, project, or assignment. You’ll find specific README files within each folder, providing more details about the content, setup instructions, and usage.

## Navigation

Feel free to explore the folders. Each one has its own README to guide you through the specifics of that particular project.
