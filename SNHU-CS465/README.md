## Architecture
The Travlr Getaways project was split into two sections: one side for customers and the other for administrative control over the site. Because of this, many different technologies were used for this project. For the customer-facing portion, Express was used from the MEAN stack to create a straightforward web app. This setup was using easily modifiable views for each customer-accessible page, with each HTML file being fetched dynamically based on user navigation. JavaScript had a large role in managing API controllers, making sure any updates made by administrators were immediately reflected on the customer side. For the admin interface, Angular was used to create an SPA, using a login system to allow for trip management by authorized users. The SPA allowed the admins to do CRUD operations, and gave them a place to modify trip data. The backend relied on MongoDB for its simplicity and ease of integration, and it stored trip information and user details.
## Functionality
The JSON format was used as a bridge between the frontend and backend. Unlike JavaScript, which is used for scripting and interactivity, JSON acts as a straightforward format for data exchange, and streamlined the communication between the two ends of the application. 
During the project, we improved efficiency and functionality by refactoring the code to introduce a TripListingComponent in Angular. This move separated the trip listing logic into its own reusable component. The advantage of this approach was twofold: it simplified the integration of trip listings across various parts of the application without the need to replicate code, and it streamlined future updates and maintenance by centralizing changes to a single component. This method of utilizing reusable UI components reduced complexity and enhanced the scalability of our application, showing the practical benefits of reusable UI strategies.
## Testing
In this project, we used HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow users to interact with a website, allowing them to view, add, update, or delete information. These methods target endpoints, which are specific URLs designed to respond to user requests and perform actions on the database. Testing these endpoints is important to making sure they work properly and show the right data or errors when expected. Tools like Postman help test these, even when security features are in play to stop unauthorized access. With security, the important thing with testing is ensuring you are following the rules of the app as well. For example, before submitting a POST that's locked behind authentication, authenticate yourself as an admin first. Security is the layer we add to make sure only the right users can see or change information. This is crucial for keeping the application safe and running smoothly, making sure that operations like adding or editing content are secure. Balancing the technical aspects with security while keeping the user experience smooth is an important part of developing a successful full stack application.
## Reflection
This course has been a great opportunity for me, especially with learning Express, which was new ground as I've mainly worked with Angular and C# Dotnet APIs. Diving into Express helped me understand how to manage a whole different approach to server side functionality. It also allowed me to deepen my knowledge of concepts I'd encountered at work, especially with Angular, showing me a bigger picture and greater context. As a result, I've become more adaptable and capable of managing a bigger range of tasks within web development, improving my overall contribution to projects.
